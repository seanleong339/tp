## Introduction

Being a Job Recruiter means working in a **fast paced environment with long hours**, and a need to have **attention to 
details**. It is a job where **time is money** as the number of applicants that sign to a job determines the amount of 
commission earned.

Hence, introducing **ReCLIne**. ReCLIne is a **desktop app which serves as a centralised location for recruiters to 
store and track job applicants and jobs, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having 
the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ReCLIne can get your contact management tasks 
done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## How to use this guide
The **goal of this guide** is to help you, the users, to **understand** how to use our application better. 
* If you are a **new user**, we recommend going to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section, to learn how to install the 
application onto your device and to have a quick try at some commands that ReCLIne provides.
* If you are an **experienced user**, we recommend going to the [Features](#features) section to view all the commands
available on ReCLIne.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addapplicant n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addapplicant n/John Doe`.

* Items **with** an asterisk before the flag are compulsory.<br>
  e.g `*n/[NAME] *p/[PHONE]` can only be used as `n/John Doe p/93483747`.
  
* Items **without** an asterisk before the flag are optional.<br>
  e.g `*n/[NAME] t/[TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/Applicant` or `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters 
  (such as `help`, `listapplicant`, `listjob`, `tabapplicant`, `tabjob`, `exit` and `clear`)
  will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### Saving the data

ReCLIne data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Users who are unfamiliar with programming can safely ignore this section of the user guide.
ReCLIne data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/ReCLIne.json`. We strongly advise users __not__ to edit the data file as a single wrong error such as naming the "applicants" array as "Applicants" will cause the data file to fail and start with an empty list.
Advanced users who are familiar with Javascript and JSON objects are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file, and following the sample format shown below.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
We would like to remind users again, if your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, ReCLIne will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>

**A**: <ol><li>Download the `ReCLIne.jar` to a new empty folder on your other Computer.</li>
          <li>Run the application for the first time on your new device by double clicking on the `ReCLIne.jar` file.</li>
          <li>Run the command `deletejob 1` to save a new data file.</li>
          <li>In the folder containing your `ReCLIne.jar` go into the `data` folder.</li>
          <li>Delete the `ReCLIne.json` file here, then copy the `ReCLIne.json` file on your old device to this folder. The file can be found in the same folder on your old device as your new device.</li> 
       </ol>
        The file structure of your new ReCLIne application should be as such after Step 2.
